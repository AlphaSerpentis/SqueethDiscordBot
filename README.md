# Requirements to Self-Host

- Java 8+
- Discord Bot Token
- Laevitas API Key
- A Computer That Doesn't Explode and Can Run 24/7 (hopefully)

When self-hosting, pass the following arguments to the jar when running:

1. [Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Laevitas API Key
3. Your Discord User ID (to run bot admin commands)
4. Path to a JSON file to store server data
5. True/False (only run true if you updated the bot, then afterwards false)

Failure to pass these four arguments in the correct order may result in either the bot outright crashing, unexpected behavior, and/or not enough Squeeth memes.
