# Squeeth Discord Bot
A Discord bot based on JDA that provides you with quick and easy access to info of the Squeeth ecosystem

# Requirements to Self-Host

- Java 8+
- Discord Bot Token
- Laevitas API Key
- A Computer That Doesn't Explode and Can Run 24/7 (hopefully)

When self-hosting, pass the following arguments to the jar when running:

1. Discord Bot Token
2. Laevitas API Key
3. Your Discord User ID (to run bot admin commands)

Failure to pass these three arguments in the correct order may result in either the bot outright crashing, unexpected behavior, and/or not enough Squeeth memes.
